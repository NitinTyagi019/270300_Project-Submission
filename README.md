[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/87fc325c20584526b6b64c8ff3633125)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/NitinTyagi019/270300_Project-Submission/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=NitinTyagi019/270300_Project-Submission&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Analysis the data

### By analysing we came to these decisions:

* female have more chances of survival as compared to male.
* higher the number of your class higher is the survival rate.
* if you belongs to 'C' then your survival rate is higher.

## Visualize the data

### By visualizing we came to these decisions:

* Younger and older people survived.
* The middle age (20-40) people did not survive.
* Pclass=3 has lesser chance of survival.

## Preprocessing

* In this dataset, First we searched for the missing data. Then we filled the missing values by taking mean or by taking the most approprite value for column.
* drop unwanted columns from the dataset.
* Map female to 1 and male to 0 in dataset.

## Machine Learning Models

### In this we are comparing between 5 models and based on the accuracy, we will able to decide whether which model is perfect for this problem.

* These five models are: 
* 1. Logistic Regression
* 2. Support Vector Machines
* 3. Decision Tree Classifier
* 4. Random Forest
* 5. KNN Neighbors**

### Model Evalution

* As we evaluate models based on their accuracy levels on the given dataset. It seems that 'Random Forest' and 'Decision Tree' both are giving the same accuracy. So here we can use both of them in this prediction.

## Result

* Accuracy of these models comes out to be 86.31 .
